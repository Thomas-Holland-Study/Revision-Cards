# Revision-Cards

This includes any [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) decks I have made for my studies.

I have grouped them into folders that are "decks" based on a theme (e.g. Geological Time) that includes both [.apkg](https://docs.ankiweb.net/exporting.html?highlight=expore#deck-apkg) and as a [text file](https://docs.ankiweb.net/exporting.html?highlight=expore#text-files). If importing .apkg is preferred and can be imported again for updates (keeping scheduling information you have created).
